# 🎬 Movie Library  

A responsive movie discovery web application that allows users to browse trending films, search for titles, view details, and build a personal watchlist.  
The app is designed for movie lovers who want a clean, fast, and modern interface for exploring films using real‑time data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

## Overview

### Motivation
I built this project to strengthen my frontend development skills, learn how to integrate external APIs, and create a polished portfolio piece that demonstrates real‑world UI/UX patterns such as infinite scroll, search, routing, and state management.

### Objective
The goal of this application is to provide a simple, elegant interface for discovering movies. Users can browse popular films, search for specific titles, and save favourites to a watchlist — all powered by live TMDB data.

### Learning Outcomes
- Integrated a third‑party API (TMDB)
- Implemented infinite scroll with Intersection Observer
- Built reusable React components
- Managed global state with Context API
- Designed responsive UI layouts
- Deployed a production‑ready frontend

---

## Architecture

1.  
Client (React Frontend)  
↓  
TMDB API (External Data Source)  

Folder Structure Example:

```
client/
  ├── src/
  │    ├── components/
  │    ├── pages/
  │    ├── contexts/
  │    ├── services/
  │    ├── css/
  │    └── App.jsx
  └── index.html
```

 ├── password
 └── created_at

watchlist
 ├── id
 ├── user_id
 ├── movie_id
 └── added_at
```
